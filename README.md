**Vanilla Liquid Time Constant Neural Network Implementation**

This is a simple illustration of Liquid Time Constant Networks or LTC's, [Hasani,Lechner,Amini-2020] using a vanilla ode solver, 
and vanilla (BPTT) optimization. It is tested on a periodic (sine) function with 50 data points.

The test can be run with sine_test.py which will instantiate and train a single LTC neuron to the test function.

The dependencies for running this repo are simply numpy and matplotlib.
